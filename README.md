# Earthquake Prediction and Alarm System

Welcome to the Earthquake Prediction and Alarm System project! This repository contains a simplified example of a machine learning-based earthquake prediction model that triggers real-time alarms in response to detected earthquakes.

**Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and does not guarantee accurate earthquake prediction or real-time response. Actual earthquake prediction is a complex scientific challenge.**

## Introduction

Earthquake prediction remains a challenging scientific problem. This project provides an illustrative example of a basic earthquake prediction model using machine learning techniques. It simulates real-time prediction and alarm using randomized data.

## Features

- Machine learning-based earthquake prediction using a simple model (Random Forest).
- Simulated real-time earthquake prediction.
- Basic alarm system triggered by earthquake predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/earthquake-prediction.git
   cd earthquake-prediction

Install Dependencies:

This example uses Python. Make sure you have Python and pip installed.

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn playsound
Run the Project:

bash
Copy code
python earthquake_prediction.py
Modify the script according to your actual data and needs.

Dependencies
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
playsound
Usage
Data Preparation:

Replace the example CSV data (earthquake_data.csv) with your actual seismic data. Ensure the CSV file contains appropriate columns for features and labels.

Model Training:

Replace the model creation with your own trained model or machine learning algorithm.

Real-Time Prediction and Alarm:

Modify the prediction and alarm logic for your specific hardware setup.
